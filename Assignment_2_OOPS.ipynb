        "\n",
        "1. Read-only attributes: Decorate the attributes in the parent class with the @property decorator and implement the getter method to return the attribute value but not allow modification. This method ensures that child classes can access the attribute but cannot directly assign a new value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Private methods: Implement the methods in the parent class as private methods using the __ prefix before the method name. This prevents direct access to the method from child classes, forcing them to implement their own versions or override the method behavior through super() calls.\n",

        "\n",
        "Method Overloading\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class. This allows for the same method name to be used for different operations, depending on the type or number of arguments passed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, method overloading is not directly supported. However, it can be achieved using various techniques, such as using the *args and **kwargs syntax for variable-length argument lists or employing decorators to dynamically dispatch method calls based on argument types.\n",

        "Encapsulation in Python is a concept of object-oriented programming that refers to the bundling of data and methods together into a single unit. This unit, known as a class, conceals the implementation details of the data and methods from the outside world. Instead, the class exposes a set of public methods that allow users to interact with the data in a controlled and predictable manner."

        "The key principles of encapsulation in Python are access control and data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access control is the mechanism by which encapsulation regulates access to the data and methods of a class. Encapsulation allows us to control which parts of a class are accessible to the outside world and which parts are hidden. This helps to protect the data and methods of a class from accidental modification or misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access control in Python is implemented using the following modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Public: Public members of a class are accessible to everyone.\n",
        "2. Protected: Protected members of a class are accessible to the class itself and to its subclasses.\n",
        "3. Private: Private members of a class are only accessible to the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data hiding is the practice of concealing the implementation details of a class from the outside world. Data hiding is achieved by declaring the data members of a class as private. This prevents the outside world from directly accessing or modifying the data members. Instead, the outside world must interact with the data members through the class's public methods.\n",

        "1. Data protection: Data hiding helps to protect the data of a class from accidental modification or misuse.\n",
        "2. Code readability and maintainability: Data hiding makes code more readable and maintainable by grouping related data and methods together into a single unit.\n",
        "3. Flexibility: Data hiding allows us to change the implementation of a class without affecting its clients. This makes our code more flexible and adaptable to change."

        "\n",
        "1. Managing Complexity: Large-scale software systems often involve a multitude of interconnected components, making them inherently complex. Abstraction helps to break down this complexity into manageable units by hiding the intricate details of individual components and focusing on their essential functionalities. This allows developers to work on specific modules without being overwhelmed by the entire system's intricacies.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a \"has-a\" relationship represents a composition between classes. Composition involves creating new classes by combining existing objects. It establishes a \"has-a\" relationship between the classes, where one class, known as the composite, contains references to objects of other classes, called components.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"has-a\" relationship is a fundamental concept in OOP that plays a crucial role in designing software systems. It promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability by allowing developers to break down complex systems into smaller, independent components and combine them in a structured manner.\n",

        "4. Flexibility: Composition provides a flexible approach to software design. It allows for combining different components from various sources to create complex systems without rigid class hierarchies.\n",

        "Encapsulation and information hiding are fundamental principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) that aim to conceal the internal implementation details of an object, providing a clear interface for interaction while protecting the object's internal state. In Python classes, encapsulation can be achieved using various techniques, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Public, Private, and Protected Methods: Python uses access modifiers to control access to class methods and attributes. Public methods are accessible from outside the class, private methods can only be called from within the class, and protected methods can be accessed from within the class and its subclasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition plays a crucial role in enhancing code maintainability and modularity in Python programs. It promotes a clear and organized structure by dividing complex systems into smaller, independent modules. This approach offers several advantages for maintaining and improving code quality:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Reduced Complexity: Composition breaks down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components, making the code easier to understand, modify, and debug. Each component has a well-defined purpose and interacts with other components through clear interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Improved Modularity: Composition promotes modularity by encapsulating the functionalities of individual components within their respective classes. This allows for independent development and testing of components, reducing the impact of changes on other parts of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Enhanced Reusability: Composition encourages code reusability by promoting the creation of reusable components. These components can be combined in different ways to create various functionalities, reducing duplication and promoting code efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Simplified Maintenance: Composition simplifies maintenance by isolating changes to specific components. Changes made to one component do not directly affect other components, making it easier to manage and maintain the overall system.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Clearer Design: Composition leads to a clearer design by separating responsibilities between classes and promoting loose coupling. Each class is responsible for a specific set of tasks, making the code more organized and less prone to unexpected interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Reduced Interdependencies: Composition reduces interdependencies between classes by minimizing direct interactions. This makes it easier to modify or replace individual components without affecting the entire system.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Encapsulation and Information Hiding: Composition promotes encapsulation and information hiding by restricting direct access to a component's internal state. This ensures that components can communicate through controlled interfaces, protecting their internal data and preventing unintended modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Flexible and Adaptable Design: Composition leads to a more flexible and adaptable design by allowing for the addition or removal of components without significantly altering the overall structure. This makes it easier to accommodate evolving requirements and enhance the system over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "By effectively utilizing composition, Python developers can create maintainable, modular, and reusable code that is easier to understand, modify, and adapt to changing requirements. This approach promotes better software quality and long-term maintainability."

        "\n",
        "Achieving flexibility in composed objects by allowing them to be replaced or modified dynamically at runtime can be achieved through various techniques, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Dependency Injection: This approach involves injecting dependencies into objects at runtime, allowing for dynamic substitution of components. For instance, in a game development context, different weapon or armor implementations can be injected into a character object, enabling dynamic changes to the character's capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dynamic Class Loading: This technique involves loading and instantiating classes at runtime, enabling the introduction of new or modified components without requiring recompilation of the entire application. For example, in a plugin-based system, new plugins can be loaded and integrated with the existing application at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reflection and Metaprogramming: These techniques allow for introspection and manipulation of objects and their properties at runtime. Reflection enables developers to query and modify the structure and behavior of objects, providing flexibility in adapting to changing requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP introduces the concept of aspects, which cross-cut multiple modules or components. Aspects can be dynamically added or removed at runtime, allowing for non-intrusive modification of object behavior without directly altering their code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Event-Driven Architecture: In an event-driven architecture, components communicate through events, enabling loose coupling and dynamic composition. Components can subscribe and unsubscribe to events at runtime, adapting to changing requirements without requiring tight coupling between components.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Scriptable Behavior: Embedding scripting languages within the application allows for dynamic modification of object behavior through scripts. Developers can create and execute scripts at runtime, altering the behavior of objects without recompiling or modifying their source code.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Configuration Files: Utilizing configuration files to store and load object properties and configurations enables dynamic adjustments at runtime. Developers can modify configuration files without recompiling the application, allowing for flexible changes to object behavior and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Behavioral Design Patterns: Employing behavioral design patterns, such as the Strategy pattern and the Decorator pattern, promotes flexibility in object composition."
